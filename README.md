# Polynomial-Aggregate-Linq
You are required to calculate the value of an nth-degree polynomial. The function is called Poly and the arguments are:

•	int x - the value of x for the polynomial

•	IEnumberable<int> coeffs - the polynomial coefficients
  
Example:

•	Input: 2, [3,4,5] and some other examples

•	Output: 25 (calculated as 3*2^2+4*2+5)

Hint: you may need the overload of Aggregate° that takes a seed value. You may also need to introduce a separate variable for tracking the index of the element you're processing.
